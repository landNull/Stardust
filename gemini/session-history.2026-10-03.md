## Gitea Installation via install-stardust.sh

**Objective**: Successfully install and configure Gitea as part of the Stardust project, addressing the issue of non-interactive installation prompts.

**Action Taken**:
Used the `install-stardust.sh` script with `GITEA_INSTALL=Y` and piped in answers to the interactive prompts to simulate an interactive installation.

**Key Configuration Details**:
*   **Gitea Version**: 1.27.3 (arm64 architecture detected)
*   **Domain**: `git.localhost.localdomain`
*   **Apache Reverse Proxy**: Enabled
*   **SSH Mode**: `system` (using OpenSSH on port 22)
*   **Database**: `sqlite3`
*   **Admin Username**: `goose`
*   **Admin Email**: `goose@git.devel`
*   **Admin Password**: `d2WDrZ01j32NHirZo1VU` (Auto-generated and stored in `/srv/stardust/state/secrets/gitea-admin.txt`)
*   **Git SSH Host Alias**: `gitea-starhq`
*   **Git Owner/Organization**: `myorg`
*   **Deploy Key**: Generated at `/srv/stardust/home/.ssh/id_ed25519`

**Outcome**:
Gitea has been successfully installed and configured. The service `gitea` is running.

**Access Information**:
*   **Gitea URL**: `http://git.localhost.localdomain/`
*   **Admin User**: `goose`
*   **Admin Password**: `d2WDrZ01j32NHirZo1VU` (Please retrieve from `/srv/stardust/state/secrets/gitea-admin.txt` for future use.)

**Next Steps Recommended**:
1.  Add the public deploy key (from `/srv/stardust/home/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) to Gitea for the `deploy` user or as an organization deploy key.
2.  Test Git operations (clone, push) using the configured `STARDUST_GIT_TEMPLATE`.

## Session Work Summary - October 3, 2026

**Focus**: Ensuring interactive Gitea installation prompts within the `install-stardust.sh` script, especially for the `devel` role.

**Problem**: The `apps/gitea/install.sh` script was designed to skip interactive prompts in non-TTY environments or when the `GITEA_INSTALL` environment variable was not explicitly set. This led to Gitea being installed with default values without user input, even when running the main installer in `devel` mode.

**Actions Taken**:
1.  **Investigated `install-stardust.sh` and `apps/gitea/install.sh`**: Examined how the Gitea installation phase is triggered and the conditions under which interactive prompts are displayed or skipped.
2.  **Identified Blocking Logic**: Pinpointed the conditional block in `apps/gitea/install.sh` responsible for skipping interactive prompts based on TTY presence and `GITEA_INSTALL` variable.
3.  **Modified `apps/gitea/install.sh`**: Removed the `if [ ! -t 0 ] && [ -z "$env_inst" ]` block that caused the premature exit from the Gitea installation phase. This ensures the script attempts Gitea installation in `devel` mode, always.
4.  **Version Control**:
    *   Created a new branch: `apps/gitea-install`.
    *   Committed the changes to `apps/gitea/install.sh` (and noted a mode change in `cleanup-stardust.sh`).
    *   Pushed the `apps/gitea-install` branch to the remote.
    *   Checked out the `devel` branch.
    *   Merged `apps/gitea-install` into `devel`.
    *   Pushed the updated `devel` branch to the remote.

**Outcome**:
The `apps/gitea/install.sh` script has been updated. Now, when `install-stardust.sh -m devel` is run:
*   In an interactive terminal, it will reliably present all Gitea configuration prompts (subdomain, admin user, etc.) with the full `? help` functionality.
*   In a non-interactive environment, it will proceed with Gitea installation using default values and automatically generate credentials, without hanging.

**Next Steps**:
The user should now be able to run `./install-stardust.sh -m devel` in their interactive terminal and experience the intended interactive Gitea setup.
